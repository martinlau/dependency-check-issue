# Goal

Configure dependency-check-maven in a parent POM, allowing suppressions to be loaded from a known location (src/build/suppressions.xml) in a child project (if defined), based on the configuration described in https://github.com/jeremylong/DependencyCheck/issues/3947#issuecomment-1005024826.

# Running the reactor build:

Note that the suppressions are not loaded (for the full output with debug logging turned on see [reactor-build.log](reactor-build.log):
